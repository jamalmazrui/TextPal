TextPal, a Windows text editor -- designed for accessible and efficient use from the keyboard -- is a retired software project of mine, replaced by the EdSharp editor.  The program no longer works.  In the spirit of open source software, however, I am publishing the last version, TextPal 3.9 (mainly written in Ruby), in case any of its code or ideas benefit projects by other developers.

Full documentation is in the file TextPal.htm.  TextPal39.zip is an archive of a fresh installation of TextPal 3.9.

More information about TextPal is excerpted from its user guide as follows:

TextPal is a full featured text editor that is friendly, powerful, and open source.  It uses a standard Windows interface for an application that supports multiple document windows.  It seeks to optimize efficiency for users of the JAWS or Window-Eyes screen readers by automatically verbalizing relevant information.  If neither JAWS or Window-Eyes are detected in memory, TextPal uses the default SAPI voice, if available, which may be configured via the Speech applet in Control Panel.
